title: Barely There - Say "yes" to Open Acess
summary: The tug of war between researchers and info consumers should be handled by a culture of open scholarship.

Over the weekend, I watched React.js: The Documentary by Honeypot which recounted how a bunch of passionated software engineers pushed to open-source a UI framework that they believed it could revolutionize how to build user interfaces.

The React team went through many hurdles such as negative reactions from the Javascript community when they open-sourced the project and internal struggles around the company (Facebook) they were part of an engineering team. It only took a simple try of early adopters to have ReactJs reintroduced to the JS community.

It got me thinking, is an open access the way to go?

In theory, openness has been established as part of responsible or ethical research. Open scholarship practices such as study group registrations, info sharing, and open access publishing have for the longest time been ignored and their adoption practices remain limited.

Open access makes information and knowledge transparent, shareable, and inclusive to all who are willing to consume it. It may sound like an endeavor of clicking a share button but it is a challenging practice to conduct.

Societal expectations and the invention of new digital tools have been for the longest time on the necks of research communities requesting, mobilizing, enhancing, and sometimes demanding for an increase in the transparency of research. However, the researchers are still stuck on traditional scholarship that is based on one question:

What's in it for me?

This question covers all the barriers to open scholarship as it can mean about 5 things.

First, focus on prestige - the researcher wants to have sole control and ownership of the research work. Logically, the researcher has all rights to own it. It is his/her work. But a fundamental question rises from here, did they utilize external information or knowledge to accomplish their work? Certainly YES. Then, why are they not ready to share their research work as their predecessors did?

Ignorance is the second reason as the researchers lack copyright knowledge. Ironically, there is the inability to determine whether the work should be in the public domain or they should have an in-copyright before open access release.

There is a concern about being scooped, and taken advantage of their hard work. Copyright provides authorship of the research and the references provided indicate the real sole owner of the work.

Cost - the economic story of copyright indicates plainly that creators are not in support of open scholarship because they expect to be paid for their work. This is a practical barrier as it leads to licensing and paywalls. Is it ethical to paywall knowledge that one has deduced from other research works?

Desire to retain control. The researchers are in constant fear that they will lose their work and its educational context forever if they do not have a licensing model from the start. It is true. There are unscrupulous entities or individuals who are ever-ready to free-ride on other peoples' works.

## Common Ground

The road to Open Acess has been tough and tiring. The ground which both parties can settle on is thorny. It is not a scenario of give and take. It is a discussion that involves strings of questions asking ourselves why we conduct research works.

Are there ways to persuade the researchers to care?

Yes, but it must come from the research community itself. There is a need to change ways in which the researchers are rewarded, not for the information or knowledge they produce but for their efforts to reproduce and compile the information. When open science becomes part of the research community there is low entry into a learning opportunities and contributions to the research work making it more useful to a greater audience.

The culture of open access has been community before individual and understanding that sharing makes better science.

It is a long way to go but I feel that we are on the right track despite us making baby steps with our capabilities running. One day!
