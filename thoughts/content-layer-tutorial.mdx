title: Why I choose Nextjs and Contentlayer for this blog.
summary: My thoughts are precious and they need perfect tech stack (Nextjs & Contentlayer) to make a future-proof archive.

**Disclaimer**: As I write this post, Contentlayer is still in development and some APIs might change!

I was looking for tech stack to build a website using Nextjs and MDX files.

The obvious choice that came into my mind was a combo of **[Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)** and **[MDX](https://www.markdownguide.org/)**.

However, I have felt for the longest time that writing content for developers should way easier that what MDX or ever-ending CMS platforms offers.

The complexity of using Markdown files in the project is brought by the increasing markdown processing logic such as plugins and content-processing libraries.

At whose cost?

Me as the developer. I believe content validation should be logical enough and the framework I choose should encouraged separate of concerns from the word go.

The last nail on coffin for Markdown files usage as content source comes from its barely-there support of **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**. Writing types manually is cumbersome and it puts on a worry _hoping_ that content data matches the types.

Hope is cruel. It is a world I wouldn't like to dwell in. Infact, _"Hope in reality is the worst of all evils"_ - **Friedrich Nietzsche**

## **What is Contentlayer?**

**[Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer)** turns your content into data - making it super easy to import MD(X) and CMS content in your app.

I was convinced by the Contentlayer primary focus of **Thinking Content as Data**.

It is obvious that content-driven user experiences have evolved from monolothic CMS such as Wordpress to modern web experiences such as using Nextjs.

Content edges Markdown files in the following areas:

1. Typescript Support - Typescript is king! Modern web experiences are developed and frameworks such as Nextjs have integrated as default in their code bases. Contentlayer allows type definitions on every document type.

2. Content as Data - with contentlayer content and its rules works.

3. Live-reload and caching - content is cached and incrementally generated with minimal effort.

I am huge fan of automatic reload when content changes as it makes development work easier.

4. Flexible content modelling - structuring content is made easier and it becomes powerful when you want to integrate it in your web framework.

5. Content validation - automatically validation with helpful error messages at the console makes developement easy and it allows efficient debugging.

Contentlayer may be at beta stage but I believe it is one of the OSS project I will be looking forward as it becomes stable.
