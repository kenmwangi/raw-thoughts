Blood is blood. Blood never lies. Does it?

Faced with difficult situations, a dilemma or an insurmountable act we always choose blood.
We all fall back there, no matter how we convince ourselves that we can make external allies, we always fall back there.
Blood murmurs.

It contains so many secrets that it cannot talk loudly since the world will burst.
When blood gives a secret, we exprience an apocalypse, annihilation or an extinction. Did one dinosaur betray the blood? Maybe.
Always - _la sangre es sangre_.

In the book _We were liars_ by **e. lockhart** it starts by stating that in Sinclair's family no one is a criminal, no one is a failure, no is an addict.
They believed they are all handsome, aggressive and their smiles are wide.
It may sound mirage based on our experiences but we are all liars.
They are blood. Their kind is bold. They may not mean it but they believe it.

We defend our kind not because we love them or we know they are innocent but rather because the coin flipped long time ago.
Nature does not control humans as it did. Since the first existence of humanity, humans survival depended on nature.
We are gradually controlling the nature, even our kind!

Today, natural environment is dependent of human abilities to control their kind - _fellow population_ - for survival, else there will be disastrous occurences.

There are some things which are difficult to fathom or explain to drive a point home
blood connection being one of it despite it influencing humans to have a fragile relationship with nature.

According to legends, a seer named Tenoch lead Mexica people to the valley of Mexico in search for a place to settle based on mythical belief that Mexica people should settle
in a place where they will find an eagle fighting a snake. As they maraund all over great lakes of Mexico searching their promised land, they were forced by native tribes occupying land unhabitated by waters to occupy an
island in the middle of the lake. Natives tribe wanted the nature to control Aztecs since the island was infested with poisonous snakes. Natives kind could not control the nature. Not quite.

To native tribes disappointment! Aztecs found their sign of eagle mauling snake with its beak on top of a cactus.
If that is not enough, where Aztecs came from snakes were considered a delicacy. Tenoch and people of his kind control the nature there occupying the area up to date (not sure).
Our kind may not be kind, one-call away or defend us they way we defend them, but they are blood.

## Le sangre es sangre

These words means now, as they meant in the previous sentences.

I believe in them!
