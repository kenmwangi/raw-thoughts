# Raw Thoughts

[![Raw Thoughts CI](https://github.com/kenmwangi/raw-thoughts/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kenmwangi/raw-thoughts/actions/workflows/main.yml)

My goal is to have a personal space I can archive my raw thoughts.

What I think is random and I will have more thoughts next minute, hour or day - but it will be best if I keep them thoughts which are overflowing somewhere as a way of letting out what I'm feeling at a given time.

## How I worked on this project

1. I wanted to have a simple UI design.
2. The tech stack of **Nextjs** (UI), **Tailwindcss** (styling) **Contentlayer** (content generation) seemed as the perfect combination.
3. There is integration of Feature Branches and Continuos Integration since I want to make this _"blog"_ open-source in the future.

## Why I built this minimalist blog this way

1. The plan is to make this project proper full-stack, where I will add authentication, some backend codebases and testing.
2. I was torn between Contentlayer (Beta) and Markdown since they can be integrated in the Nextjs. The motivation for using Contentlayer despite is being in beta stage was how laborious and difficult it is to use.
3. I'm in full-stack development journey, I need to have useful projects in my portfolio ü´£Ô∏è.

## Future contributions I look forward to

1. Refactor the code.
2. Add end-to-end tests with Cypress.
3. Have a proper documentation on this project (seriously) üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èÔ∏è.
